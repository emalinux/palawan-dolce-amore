**Palawan Dolce Amore Tribe Association** is a small non-profit initiative that supports tribal communities living in remote areas of Palawan, Philippines.

Our goals are simple and concrete:

- 📌 Help children and families access **basic health care**
- 🍚 Support **food distribution** in the most fragile villages
- 🎒 Promote **education and awareness** of their rights
- 🧱 Improve everyday life with **small but tangible projects** (bikes, school materials, repairs, etc.)

The association is run by volunteers and lives thanks to donations and small fundraising events organized in Italy and abroad.
