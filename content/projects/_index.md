🌱 *Small projects, real impact.*

Every year the **Palawan “Dolce Amore” Tribe Association** carries out simple but concrete projects in remote tribal communities in Palawan, Philippines.  
Thanks to donations and volunteers, even a small contribution becomes **food, school materials, transport and medical support**.

Our projects mainly focus on:

- 🍚 **Food & basic necessities** for families and children
- 🎒 **School materials** and support for education
- 🚑 **Medical help & transport** for people in remote areas
- 🤝 **Community activities** that build pride, courage and dignity
